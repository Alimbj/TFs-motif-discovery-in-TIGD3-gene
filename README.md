# TFs-motif-discovery-in-TIGD3-gene
Participated in the IBIS Challenge (https://ibis.autosome.org/home), focusing on discovering transcription factor (TF) motifs within DNA sequences of the TIGD3 gene. The goal was to identify key motifs that regulate gene expression using advanced data analysis techniques.
